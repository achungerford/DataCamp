This is an [R Notebook](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com).

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

# R Notebook

Step 1: When you're creating the project, be sure to click `R Notebook` and not `R Markdown...`

```{r}
# load data, display first 6 rows
data("mtcars")
head(mtcars)
```

**Insert Chunk** button on the toolbar or `Ctrl+Alt+I`.




```{python}


```

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
